#Reddit Reader

This is a little single-page reddit reader that I used as an experiment in using Meteor to access external data and subscribe to it.

In addition, it was an experiment in working further with the DOM inside Meteor's event handlers.

##Future Improvements

* Login system
* Save your subreddits in history
* Interact with the Reddit API, not just their JSON pages
* Add comment pages
* Improve media management (allow videos, gifv, mp4)
